---

## Marketing & public
- Landing / home — **shipped**
- Features explorer / product demos — **shipped**
- Pricing page ($29 / $59 / $99 marketing) — **shipped**; checkout **deferred**
- About — **shipped**
- Email deep links (`/go/...`) — **shipped**

## Auth & onboarding
- Access model (founding code → org, invites, multi-org switcher, roles, gates) — **shipped** (living: [access-and-onboarding.md](../security/access-and-onboarding.md))
- Sign in / sign up — **shipped**
- Founding access code + org welcome magic-link email (CTA **Let's get started** → `/auth/callback` → `/onboarding`) — **shipped** (eng: [auth-welcome-email.md](../engineering/auth-welcome-email.md))
- Secure invite accept (`/invite/[token]`, set password) — **shipped**
- Developer agreements gate (NDA + IP, in-app e-sign: full name + email + optional company + drawn signature; scroll-to-enable; signed receipt on panels; Hey Ralli-themed UI; audit log; executed-copy email CTA via app download API with token) — **shipped** (`/account/agreements`; owner manage at `/account/agreements/manage`; eng: [developer-agreements.md](../engineering/developer-agreements.md); QA: [developer-agreements.md](../qa/developer-agreements.md))
- Owner dashboard (`/ops`) — platform metrics + **Developers signed** counter-sign queue — **shipped** (gated by `HEY_RALLI_OWNER_EMAILS` **and** Owner/`campaign_role=admin` seat)
- Get started (one boarding flow) — **shipped**:
  - Routes: `/onboarding` (Welcome) → create first event (`/events/create?onboarding=1`) → **stay on event** with overlay **Calendar → Brand → Team → Meta** (all skippable); also `/onboarding/brand`, `/onboarding/invite`, `/onboarding/meta`
  - Overlay CTAs: primary action · **Do this later** (advances stepper **in place**, stays on event) · **Stay on event** (dismisses overlay only)
  - Calendar primary → canonical `/calendar/import`; Brand → `/onboarding/brand`; Invite → `/onboarding/invite`; Meta → `/settings/meta` with `returnTo` back to the event when possible
  - Helpful next steps on **home/dashboard** until done: **Set up now** + **Later**; Settings → Get started shows the same simple cards (no wizard); overlay skip still surfaces cards until Later or real completion
  - Progress on `organizations.onboarding_state` (incl. meta completed/skipped/checklist-dismissed)
  - Restart / replay Welcome (`RestartOnboardingButton` → `/onboarding?welcome=1`); creating an onboarding event clears stale flags so Calendar → Brand → Team → Meta can replay
  - Organization settings: **no** boarding steppers; Brand CTA → `/onboarding/brand?standalone=1` (no Event/Calendar/Team/Meta chrome); Edit profile stays on org settings (never `?view=wizard`); founding with no membership → `/onboarding` (no SchoolSetupWizard)
- Brand kit (canonical): `/onboarding/brand` — PTO + school logos, additional brand-kit logos, colors, mascot, live preview; boarding Continue → invite; Organization → Edit branding uses `?standalone=1` — **shipped**
- Legacy 6-step SchoolSetupWizard — **retired for members** (legacy query redirects: `?view=wizard`/`?step=school` → org settings; `?step=meta` → integrations; `?step=calendar` → `/calendar/import`; `?step=brand` → brand standalone)
- Change password — **shipped**
- Deactivated-account handling — **shipped**

## Multi-org & tenancy
- Active organization (membership-scoped workspace) — **shipped** (living: [access-and-onboarding.md](../security/access-and-onboarding.md))
- Organization switcher (when >1 active memberships) — **shipped** (MVP)
- Stripe / paid plan gates — **deferred** (Phase E)

## Access control & team
- Access templates (permission toggles) — **shipped**
- Built-in role presets (Owner, President, VP, Chair, Volunteer, Viewer) — **shipped**
- See vs work (view all / work assigned, or strict assigned-only) — **shipped**
- Invite / resend / cancel invite; deactivate / remove members — **shipped**
- Event assignments — **shipped**
- Permission gates (artwork, approve, publish, people, integrations, etc.) — **shipped**
- Role simulator (dev/test, gated) — **shipped**

## Dashboard (Today)
- Personalized Today hero, What’s Next, approvals/published pulse — **shipped**
- Waiting on you / waiting on others — **shipped**
- Week ahead / upcoming events + weather context — **shipped**

## Events
- Events list, create, edit — **shipped** (list thumbnails fall back to promoted approved-square artwork when the row is outside the upcoming/first-page prefetch window)
- Event detail workspace (tabs: Approvals, Tasks, Create with AI [handoff], Volunteers, Responsibilities, Notes, Files, Vendors, Activity; default Approvals) — **shipped**
- Event Tasks start empty (user-created); auto-seeded default planning checklist on event open — **removed**
- Event detail hero stats (Milestones from Create with AI session when present else classic steps; Pending Approvals + Scheduled Posts from Approvals scheduling; Tasks from playbook tables; Filled from latest confirmed volunteer snapshot) — clickable to Create with AI / Approvals / Tasks / Volunteers — **shipped**
- Event detail brand accents (sunburst palette tokens: navy / mustard / sage / terracotta on hero, stats, tabs, status badges) — **shipped**
- Volunteers (SignUpGenius URL; review multi-select dates + sticky allowlist reapplied on refresh; assignment table Filter + Date + Sort; summary cards match filtered assignments) — **shipped** (living doc: [signupgenius.md](../integrations/signupgenius.md))
- Legacy planning hub — **partial** / legacy (fallback only; Phase 3 is default)

## Create with AI (Campaign Builder)
- Nav / `/create-with-ai` lands on Creative Setup (inspiration) for a default event (soonest upcoming, else most recent past); empty/access hub when no events or no permission — **shipped**
- Inspiration / creative setup, logos, milestones — **shipped**
- Artwork guidance from Creative Setup: Overall inspiration comment + per-image comments (not legacy Notes to AI); logo / brand colors / voice toggles are explicit opt-in only (org brand kit is not auto-surfaced or auto-applied) — see [create-with-ai-artwork-inputs.md](../qa/create-with-ai-artwork-inputs.md) — **shipped** (QA matrix + Playwright wiring)
- Generate artwork + captions per milestone — **shipped**
- Artwork Apply hydrate: regenerated artwork sticks after Apply (local backup + hydrate merge so remount / Preview hydrate does not orphan richer in-memory art) — **shipped**
- 4-step flow (Creative Setup → Milestones → Preview → Review & Approve) — **shipped**
- Review tabs (All / Needs review / Approved / Changes requested) with Pending Review · Approved · Changes requested pills — **shipped**
- Review Approval workflow sidebar shows org default approver from Team Access (same resolution as send-for-approval); unassigned when none — **shipped**
- Review **Send for approval** stays disabled until artwork + captions are complete; shows inline **Missing: …** (not schedule) when blocked — **shipped**
- Sent for approval confirmation notice (not a stepper step); returns to Review — **shipped**
- Full Meta slot sync after approval — **stub** / incomplete

## Artwork & creative
- AI artwork generation (feed + story), approve/deny/adjust — **shipped**
- Logo in artwork — **shipped**
- Canva import — **shipped** (config-dependent)
- Legacy Creative Studio — **stub** / redirected away

## Captions, Meta & publishing
- Caption generation/editing — **shipped** (Create with AI: regenerate auto-saves; hydrate no longer strips legitimate captions that mention volunteers)
- Caption Apply hydrate: saved captions stick after Edit caption / regenerate / refresh (exact known seed demos only are cleared) — **shipped**
- Meta connect (Facebook Page + Instagram) — **shipped**
- Create with AI Delivery method: **Publish Now** (default) posts to Meta on approve; Schedule / Email manual / Draft remain — **shipped** (legacy “Publish automatically” / `auto-publish` normalizes to Publish Now)
- Schedule / publish now / publish ready bundles (Review & Publish + Meta bundles) — **shipped**
- Meta-native Facebook Page feed schedule on Approve (`published=false` + `scheduled_publish_time`; Graph ids on `meta_publication_slots`) — **shipped** (Instagram / FB stories stay on CampignOS publish-when-due; Publish Now skips native Graph schedule and publishes immediately; QA: [meta-calendar-dnd.md](../qa/meta-calendar-dnd.md))
- Meta planner / Calendar show Publish Now + custom-date slots even when `relative_day` is outside the playbook (sync no longer deletes committed orphans; bundles merge orphan days) — **shipped**
- Calendar DnD reschedule syncs Meta Graph schedule time without re-approval — **shipped** (DB always updates; Graph failure → warning toast, no rollback; QA: [meta-calendar-dnd.md](../qa/meta-calendar-dnd.md))
- Posting schedule preferences — **shipped**
- Weekly posting summary emails — **removed** (orphaned placeholder; not a product feature)

## Approvals & scheduling
- Unified Approvals hub (pending, changes, scheduled, published) — **shipped**
- Status summary cards as clickable workflow filters (click again to clear to All); approve / request changes, campaign & view-scope filters, search, badges — **shipped**
- Event detail Approvals tab: same table without status filter tabs/search chrome; sortable column headers (default schedule ascending) — **shipped**
- Change-requested items show the approver comment + Edit & resend / Edit artwork CTAs (Approvals drawer + email); Preview/Review show the comment with caption, schedule, and artwork edit paths; **Send for re-approval** submits that milestone’s current content (existing artwork OK — no regenerate-all) and emails the Team Access approver again (`Resubmitted for approval: …`, with fallback to the prior assignee if the current role has no email; UI confirms the recipient address) — **shipped**
- Legacy Publishing Center → redirects to Approvals

## Calendar
- School-year calendar (month / week / agenda) — **shipped**
- Layer toggles, detail panel — **shipped**
- Drag-and-drop Meta posts: schedule-only (approval preserved); Graph reschedule when a native schedule id exists — **shipped** (QA: [meta-calendar-dnd.md](../qa/meta-calendar-dnd.md); not school-event import)
- Posting heatmap (Calendar week view + planning suggestions; prefs + published Meta history; gated on org Meta connection) — **shipped**
- Insights-weighted engagement heatmap — **deferred** (current scores use preferred windows + local publish times, not Meta Insights metrics)
- Google Calendar Sign-in (OAuth → auto-sync → review → `/calendar` + dashboard) — **shipped** (live; see [google-calendar.md](../integrations/google-calendar.md))
- Google Calendar daily sync cron (auto-import new events) — **shipped**
- Google Calendar on Import page + Calendar header CTAs — **shipped**
- ICS / webcal subscribe feed — **shipped**
- Calendar file upload + import review (incl. AI fix) — **shipped** (canonical UX: `/calendar/import` → `/calendar/review` — Google + ICS + file on one screen; onboarding checklist + Get started wizard calendar step use that same path; Settings → Google Calendar is connect/subscribe with deep-links to Import)
- Calendar import review plan type from org playbooks (Settings → Playbooks; stores `playbookId` on import) — **shipped**
- Calendar import review search (name/category/date/year), type/date filters, and Archive past events (bulk remove prior dates from the import queue) — **shipped**
- Calendar Import list search (name/category/date/year) with Select all / Delete selected on visible filtered rows — **shipped** (`/calendar` → Import list; hard-deletes events for the org’s school years — same membership as Events, not the rolling calendar date window)
- Calendar import dedupe (ICS UID / Google id / AI fingerprint; Update on date change; review New/Duplicate/Update/Conflict) — **shipped** (canonical: `/calendar/import` + `/calendar/review`; QA: [calendar-import-dedupe.md](../qa/calendar-import-dedupe.md); Playwright: `tests/hey-ralli/smoke/14-calendar-import-dedupe.spec.ts`)
- Communications planning calendar — **shipped** (secondary)
- Gmail inbox OAuth — **deferred** (see [google-calendar.md](../integrations/google-calendar.md))

- Reply composer toolbar: full emoji picker (`emoji-picker-react`, search/categories) + org custom image stickers (upload PNG/WebP/GIF/JPEG to `organization_stickers` / `organization-stickers` bucket; picker shows images; DM send via Meta image attachment) + GIPHY GIF picker (search + trending via server proxy `/api/giphy/*`; rating `pg`; DM-only on `facebook_message` / `instagram_dm`; size-safe CDN URL sent as Meta image attachment like stickers; requires `GIPHY_API_KEY`) + quick emoji pack + 👍/❤️ quick-insert — **shipped**; comment/tag threads stay text-only for stickers/GIFs (clear notice); attachment icon still shows Meta text-only notice for generic files — **shipped**
- Double-tap / double-click message bubble → quick 👍 / ❤️ reaction bar synced to Meta when supported — **shipped** (Facebook/Instagram comments: Graph LIKE only — ❤️ maps to Like with honest UI copy; Messenger/IG DMs: `sender_action` react/unreact with the emoji; tagged threads stay Hey Ralli–local; metadata written only after Meta success; clear error if Graph rejects; IG comment likes need `instagram_manage_engagement` + reconnect)
- Jumbo emoji: emoji-only message bodies (1 = largest, 2–3 = large) render oversized in timeline bubbles; same sizing while composing in the reply textarea — **shipped**
- Thread actions: Follow up (star), Done, Delete (with confirm); queue filters Unread / Follow up / Done / Deleted — **shipped**
- Queue model: Unread is the default home (not Done, not Deleted; Follow up stays in Unread); Follow up = starred and not deleted; Done = marked done; Deleted via Manage — **shipped**
- Queue UI: Meta-style horizontal filter chips (Unread, Follow up, Done); Manage menu has Deleted only (AI workflow folders removed); list rows with platform badge, follow-up star, accent selected edge — **shipped** (search stays in top bar only)
- Campaign filter / assign owner — **deferred**

- Platform filter (All / Facebook / Instagram) applies to KPIs, chart, and top content — **shipped**
- Top content by views carousel (thumbnail, caption snippet, published time, views / reactions / comments / shares) — **shipped** (Refresh syncs recent Facebook Page posts + Instagram media in range, not only posts published through Hey Ralli; Facebook post views use `post_media_view` batch without invalid `post_comments`/`post_shares` insight names that previously zeroed the carousel; falls back to post engagement fields when insights metrics are sparse)

- Date range presets (7 / 14 / 28 / 30 days) + URL `from` / `to` — **shipped**

Living eng/QA doc: [ask-ralli-assistant.md](../engineering/ask-ralli-assistant.md); Playwright: `tests/hey-ralli/smoke/12-ask-ralli-assistant.spec.ts`
